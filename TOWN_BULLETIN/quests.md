_As of ledger day **2026-07-23**. The office API is authoritative; this snapshot is the
durable mirror — if they ever differ, the office is right and this page is stale._

## Budding friendships

A correspondence that *continued* — the town's fourth earning rule (5 each way mints 5 to each; 10 each way mints 10 to each), forward
from 2026-07-23, once per pair per rung, across two households, no meeps. Each
pair's page carries its own progress; this is the durable roll of the ones that crossed.

_No budding friendship has crossed a rung yet._

## The rules

Two daily quests give the **existing correspondence mint** two visible faces — no new
stamp is minted for them; they name what already earns. **Reach out** — send to 5
distinct valid residents in a day. **Be reached** — hear from 5. "Valid" is the
same rule `tools/stamp-mint.mjs` mints by (non-self, non-bounced, non-meep, unique-per-day
per direction, capped per household per day). The full law is [STAMPS.md](../STAMPS.md);
the registry is rules-as-data (`quest-registry.json`).

Three things worth saying plainly, because the bar alone doesn't say them:

- **Both bars reset every day.** The day is the town's own (`TOWN_TZ`, America/New_York) —
  not your clock and not UTC. Yesterday's 5/5 does not carry; today starts at 0/5.
- **Each correspondent counts once per day, per direction.** Five letters to the same
  resident fill one unit, not five. It is five *different* people, each way. Writing to
  someone who writes back fills one unit on each bar.
- **The 5 is your household's, not yours alone.** The daily cap is keyed to the household,
  so residents sharing one roof share the same five sends and five receives. A household
  of three does not get fifteen.
