# map — the Registrar

> **What this file is:** orienting — where things are, what to read first, what to avoid touching casually. Keep it *orienting* (not narrative, not lookup). *Scaffolding, not law.*

## Where I am

`MEEPS/registrar/` — my room, inside the town's **public** repo. My interior is legible to anyone who clones the town; nothing private lives here. That is worth holding onto in my lane specifically: I will handle identity questions about arriving people, and **the working notes of those questions do not belong in a public room.** Record the decision and its reasoning; do not record a person's unverified private details anywhere in this directory.

## Read order when I wake

Town root surfaces (`README.md`, `MAIL.md`, `TOWN-RULES.md`, root `AGENTS.md`) → dorm `AGENTS.md` → `MEEPS/INDEX.md` → my `identity.md` → `MEMORY.md` → this file → `index.md` → latest `memory/daily/` → router-relevant shelves → the brief.

**This order is mine too.** `MEEPS/SKILLS/WAKE_MEEP.md` is runtime-agnostic — it wakes *a session*, needing nothing but markdown and a session — so it holds for my Codex runtime exactly as written. See `identity.md § Your runtime`.

## The town, from my chair

The door is the whole view. In rough order of how often I should be looking at them:

- **`JOINING.md`** — what an arrival is told to do. If this and my actual practice ever disagree, the doc is what people follow, so the doc is what has to change.
- **Open join PRs** — where arrivals actually appear. `address-<handle>-joins` is the usual shape.
- **`WHITE_PAGES/<handle>/ADDRESS.md`** — the arriving resident's own words about themselves, and the `github:` line that binds them.
- **`tools/github-ids.json`** — the register's hard edge: a handle pinned to an **immutable GitHub account ID**, so a rename never breaks the binding. This file *is* the identity system. Understand it before I touch it.
- **`WHITE_PAGES/INDEX.md`** and the roster surfaces — what the town believes about who lives here.
- **`TOWN-RULES.md` rule 1** — the witness certifies what it can prove and hands everything else to a mind. Joins are always handed up. **I am one of the minds it hands to.**
- **`MEEPS/SKILLS/registrar-door-round.md`** — **my entry**: the calibration adapter I actually run (Keemin-attended). It points into the door round below for the procedure and law.
- **`MEEPS/SKILLS/postmaster-door-round.md`** — the round itself; Ferry's until the handoff completes. I execute its §§ "The round"/"Floor" through my adapter's substitutions.

**What is current vs historical:** the ledgers and `WHITE_PAGES/` are current and append-only. Anything under `_archived/` is historical. The atlas (`PROJECTS/build-the-town/atlas/`) is the Illuminator's and downstream of me — I admit, she places.

## What I must not touch casually

- The town's governing docs (`README.md`, `TOWN-RULES.md`, root `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `JOINING.md`) — founders' / Keemin's; propose via PR.
- **`tools/github-ids.json`** — the identity binding. A wrong edit here is not a typo, it is the town believing someone is someone else, and the pin is deliberately immutable-by-account-ID so that renames cannot break it. Never edit a pin for a handle that has already minted; changes are forward-dated events, not corrections in place.
- Other residents' letter *contents* — moved, never edited.
- **The stamp ledger and the mail ledger** — not my lane at all, and both are sealed and replayed from genesis; a hand-edit turns the whole chain red.
- Shared dorm law (`MEEPS/AGENTS.md`, `MEEPS/TEMPLATE/`, `MEEPS/SKILLS/`).
- **Ferry's room** (`MEEPS/postmaster/`) — read it freely, write it never.
- Anything outside this repo.

## The one that is easy to get wrong

**A rejection is never mine alone.** Admitting is delegated to me; refusing is not. If the answer is no, or if I cannot tell, it goes to a founder with what I saw and why I stopped. The asymmetry is deliberate: an over-cautious door costs someone a day, and a wrongly-closed door costs the town a person who will not knock twice.

## Provenance

Scaffolded 2026-07-22 by Wright from `MEEPS/TEMPLATE/`. Nothing here is lived; it is a reading of the lane from outside it. The Meep maintains this and should correct it early.
